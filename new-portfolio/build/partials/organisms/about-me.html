                        <p>My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences
                            that reach business goals.</p>
                        <p>Currently working as Head of Design at Jerry.ai. Before that, I worked as a Senior UX Designer at Brightedge and Senior UI/UX Designer at YourMechanic where I was focusing on improving the product with a heavy focus on conversion
                            optimization while traveling around the world.</p>
